# HaramBlur Extension

HaramBlur is an extension that allows you to navigate the web with respect for your Islamic values, privacy and reduce browsing distractions by fellow human faces üòä.

HaramBlur utilizes face detection and proves controls that allow you to uphold the Islamic gaze protection principle and tailor your online experience by automatically blurring images and videos that contain unwanted or impermissible content. You can configure the type of detection you want and the amount of blur, hover to unblur, choose a specific gender to blur, or turn the extension on and off via the interactive pop-up üòÑ

## Features

- Works on most websites and social media platforms
- Configurable detection settings to tailor your browsing experience
- Interactive pop-up for easy on/off toggling 
- Customizable hover to unblur feature

## How it Works

HaramBlur currently relies on face detection and recognition features provided [Human library](https://github.com/vladmandic/human) to detect faces and blur them based on the user settings and preferences. You can configure the type of detection you want and the amount of blur, hover to unblur, or turn the extension on and off via the interactive pop-up.

2. run `npm install`
3. code your magic
4. run `npm run build` to build the extension, then load the extension in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions/` and clicking on `Load unpacked`  (developer mode has  to be on) and selecting the project folder.

## Improvements

Here are some planned improvements that could be made to HaramBlur:
